# API contract

Everything the UI needs, and nothing it has to reach around. If a screen needs
something that is not here, please raise it rather than querying tables
directly — RLS and the scoring pass both live behind these functions.

**Call convention** — all of it is `supabase.rpc()`:

```ts
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('feed', { p_limit: 20 })
```

**Auth** — the welcome screen offers sign-up as the primary action, with
*Continue as guest* at the bottom. Both create a profile through the same
trigger, so nothing downstream distinguishes them.

```ts
// primary
await supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password })
// bottom-of-screen escape hatch
await supabase.auth.signInAnonymously()
```

**A guest upgrades in place.** Calling `updateUser({ email, password })` on an
anonymous session converts the *same* `auth.users.id`, so the same `profiles`
row — every save, dismissal, trip and itinerary survives. A trigger clears
`is_guest` automatically; the client does not need to tell the database.

```ts
await supabase.auth.updateUser({ email, password })   // nothing is lost
```

Call **`session_state()`** on load rather than inferring from three fields; it
returns `next_screen` as `'welcome' | 'picker' | 'feed'` and a `prompt_signup`
flag that only fires once a guest has three or more saves — nudging an empty
guest to sign up is how you lose them.

No function takes a profile id. The caller is resolved server-side from the JWT,
so a client cannot act as another traveler.

## The two stages

The product asks broad questions once, and specific questions only when someone
decides to plan. The schema mirrors that, and it is the single most important
thing to understand before building screens:

| | **Stage 1 — Profile** | **Stage 2 — Trip** |
|---|---|---|
| When | Signup | "Create an itinerary" |
| Scope | Evergreen, one per person | One per journey, many allowed |
| Asks | Countries you travel to · why you travel · interests | Exact city · dates & duration · neighbourhood you're staying in · party · budget · pace |
| Table | `traveler_profiles` | `trips` |

**The feed works in both states.** With no trip it is an *inspiration* feed
driven by interests, countries, and reasons — nothing is penalised for being in
the wrong city or over budget, because the traveler has not said where they are
going. Create a trip and the same feed becomes a *planning* feed: city,
neighbourhood, dates, and budget all start counting, and a wrong city is now
actively penalised.

Saves and dismissals live on the **profile**, not a trip. Someone can save a
Kyoto workshop eighteen months before booking; `trip_suggestions()` then offers
those saves back when they plan a Kyoto trip. That bridge is the reason the two
tables are separate.

## Stage 1 — onboarding, one screen

Onboarding is **one screen and three taps**. Not a form — a grid of real
experience cards with "tap three that look good". Tapping art feels like play;
a checklist feels like admin, and admin is where casual users leave.

The taps also carry far more signal than checkboxes would: choosing three cards
reveals category, price tolerance, and how touristy someone likes things, all at
once. Interests are **derived from the taps, never asked for**.

| Function | Args | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `cold_start_picks(p_country?, p_limit?)` | default `'JP'`, `12` | 12 diverse cards — one per category, spread across the locality range |
| `complete_cold_start(p_experience_ids[], p_countries?)` | uuid[] | `{ onboarded, saved, derived_interests, countries }` |
| `my_profile()` | — | identity, taste, counts, `active_trip` |
| `update_profile(...)` | `p_display_name`, `p_avatar_url`, `p_about`, `p_age_band` | the profile row |
| `my_taste()` | — | `{ confidence, declared[], learned[] }` |

```ts
const { data: picks } = await supabase.rpc('cold_start_picks', { p_country: 'JP' })
// render picks as a 3×4 grid of images; require 3 taps
await supabase.rpc('complete_cold_start', { p_experience_ids: chosen })
// → straight to the feed. Saved tab already has 3 things in it.
```

**The taps become real saves**, so the traveler never lands on an empty Saved
tab. That is deliberate — the first screen after signup should never be blank.

### What the algorithm does instead of asking

`interest_affinity()` scores every interest from behaviour, weighted by what
each action costs the traveler:

| Signal | Weight |
|---|---|
| Added to an itinerary | **+1.5** — they committed |
| Saved / tapped at cold start | +1.0 |
| Dismissed | −0.75 |

`learned_confidence()` ramps 0 → 1 across roughly twenty interactions. Scoring
blends the two: declared taste carries a brand-new account, learned taste takes
over as evidence accumulates. Card explanations follow — once confidence passes
0.3 the reason changes from *"Because you like restaurants"* to
**"More like the food you keep saving"**, which is both truer and more
persuasive.

Verified: after three taps plus four swipes, the engine had independently
learned `food +5.0 · nightlife +3.0 · traditional +2.0 · art −1.5` and re-ranked
the feed accordingly — with **nothing asked beyond the three taps**.

### Age

`p_age_band` on `update_profile` takes `under_18 · 18_24 · 25_34 · 35_44 ·
45_54 · 55_plus · undisclosed`. A band rather than a birthday: it never goes
stale, it is far less regulated personal data, and it does the one job age
genuinely needs to do here — `under_18` **hard-filters** bars, nightclubs, and
anything tagged `alcohol` out of the feed entirely. Not ranked lower; absent.

`undisclosed` is treated as an adult, so declining to answer never silently
degrades the product.

### Guest mode — skip even the taps

Every account is already anonymous, so there is no signup to skip. Guest mode
skips the *three taps*.

| Function | Args | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `continue_as_guest()` | — | `{ guest: true, onboarded: true }` |
| `claim_guest_profile(p_display_name?)` | text | the profile row — call when a guest first saves or names themselves |

The feed handles zero signal by **exploring**. `exploration_weight()` runs 1.0 →
0.0 as confidence rises, and while it is high the deck round-robins across
categories rather than ordering purely by score. A cold feed sorted by score
alone returns five variations on one category, which is both boring and the
slowest possible way to learn anything — interleaving reads as variety *and*
makes every swipe discriminate between categories instead of within one.

Verified: a guest's first eight cards covered eight distinct categories; after
eight swipes exploration had decayed and the deck had converged on the two
categories they actually picked.

### Optional: declared interests

`save_profile_onboarding(p_interests[], p_countries[], p_reasons[])` still
exists for the minority who want to curate their own taste from the profile
screen. It is no longer the primary path and should not appear during signup.

## Stage 2 — trips

| Function | Args | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `trip_options(p_country_code)` | default `'JP'` | cities (with neighbourhoods + `experience_count`), budgets, parties, paces |
| `create_trip(...)` | see below | the trip row |
| `update_trip(p_trip_id, …)` | any field | the trip row |
| `delete_trip(p_trip_id)` | uuid | `{ trip_id, deleted }` |
| `my_trips()` | — | `Trip[]` |
| `trip_suggestions(p_trip_id?)` | uuid, optional | saved items in this trip's city, not yet scheduled |

```ts
await supabase.rpc('create_trip', {
  p_city_slug: 'osaka',
  p_start_date: '2026-09-14',
  p_duration_days: 4,            // or pass p_end_date; either works
  p_neighborhood_slug: 'tenma',  // where they're staying
  p_party: 'group',
  p_budget: 'shoestring',
  p_pace: 'packed',
})
```

Travelers think in *how long*, not *which day I fly home*, so `create_trip`
accepts `p_duration_days` **or** `p_end_date` and derives the other.

Every function that takes `p_trip_id` treats it as optional and falls back to
the traveler's current trip (active first, then the soonest one being planned).
The UI only needs to pass it explicitly when the traveler is looking at a trip
that isn't their current one.

---

## Feed & discovery

| Function | Args | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `feed(p_trip_id?, p_limit, p_offset)` | defaults `null, 20, 0` | `ExperienceCard[]`, ranked |
| `explore(...)` | all optional | `ExperienceCard[]` |
| `explore_sections(p_city?, p_limit)` | | `{ happening_this_week[], hidden_local_gems[], popular_near_you[] }` |
| `experience_detail(p_experience_id)` | uuid | full detail document |

`explore` arguments: `p_query`, `p_categories text[]`, `p_city` (slug),
`p_neighborhood` (slug), `p_from date`, `p_to date`, `p_free_only bool`,
`p_max_price int`, `p_sort` (`recommended` \| `soonest` \| `price` \| `popular`),
`p_limit`, `p_offset`.

Two behaviours worth knowing:

- **`feed()` excludes what you've already saved or dismissed.** It's the swipe
  deck, so a decided card doesn't come back. Use `explore()` for everything.
- **Date filters never hide always-on attractions.** `starts_at = null` passes
  any range — filtering to "this week" shouldn't remove teamLab.

`experience_detail()` returns the card, **all** media, the host, `reasons`, and
six related experiences, so the detail page never needs a second round trip.

---

## Actions

| Function | Args | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `save_experience(id)` | uuid | `{ experience_id, is_saved, save_count }` |
| `unsave_experience(id)` | uuid | same |
| `dismiss_experience(id)` | uuid | `{ experience_id, dismissed }` |
| `undo_dismiss(id)` | uuid | same |
| `share_experience(id, p_channel?)` | uuid, text | `{ experience_id, share_count }` |
| `my_saved()` | — | saved rows, newest first |
| `add_to_itinerary(id, p_trip_id?, p_day?, p_planned_start?)` | | `{ entry_id, trip_id, day, in_itinerary }` |
| `update_itinerary_entry(p_entry_id, …)` | day/time/position/note | the entry |
| `remove_from_itinerary(id, p_trip_id?)` | | `{ experience_id, in_itinerary }` |
| `my_itinerary(p_trip_id?)` | | `{ trip, days: ItineraryDay[] }` |

All are safe to call twice — a double-tap won't error.

Behaviours the UI can rely on rather than reimplement:

- **Saving clears a dismissal; dismissing clears a save.** Last gesture wins.
- **Adding to the itinerary also saves, and clears any dismissal.**
- **`add_to_itinerary` picks the day**: the event's own date, else the trip's
  first day, else today — then **clamps it inside the trip window**, so you
  can't create a stop on a date the traveler isn't there.
- Save and share return the **new** count, so you can update optimistically and
  reconcile from the response.

`add_to_itinerary` raises **`no trip yet`** when the traveler has none. That is
not a failure case to hide — it's the cue to open the Stage 2 questions, which
is exactly where trip creation belongs in the flow.

## The AI chat sheet

> *"Make Day 2 lighter." · "Move the ramen tour later." · "Add something free on Thursday."*

The one call in the product that does **not** go straight to Postgres. Claude
Sonnet 5 runs server-side, because an Anthropic API key cannot ship to a
browser the way the Supabase anon key can.

```ts
import { askAboutItinerary } from '@/lib/roam'

const { reply, actions, plan } = await askAboutItinerary(tripId, [
  ...history,
  { role: 'user', content: 'Make Day 2 lighter' },
])
```

Re-render the timeline from `result.plan` — it is the itinerary *after* the
edits, every day including empty ones, so there is no refetch. `result.actions`
says what changed (`added` / `moved` / `removed` / `rebuilt`) if you want to
animate the specific row rather than diff the whole plan.

**Three files, one secret.**

| File | Copy to | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/itinerary-agent.ts` | `src/lib/itinerary-agent.ts` | tools + prompt. **Server only.** |
| `docs/itinerary-chat-route.ts` | `src/app/api/itinerary/chat/route.ts` | the POST handler |
| `askAboutItinerary()` in `roam-client.ts` | already there | the browser call |

```bash
npm i @anthropic-ai/sdk zod
echo 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...' >> .env.local   # NOT NEXT_PUBLIC_
```

### Why this is not a second way into the data

Claude gets **eight tools, and every one is an RPC from the table above** —
`get_plan`, `search_experiences`, `list_saved`, `add_stop`, `move_stop`,
`remove_stop`, `rebuild_plan`, `check_conflicts`. It has no database
connection and writes no SQL. Anything the sheet can do, a thumb could already
have done on the same screen.

- **RLS is unchanged.** The route forwards the traveler's own access token, so
  `current_profile_id()` resolves to them exactly as in the browser. The
  service-role key is never used here. A jailbroken prompt still cannot read
  one row belonging to anybody else.
- **The trip is pinned server-side.** `tripId` comes from the request, never
  from the model, and `move_stop` rejects an entry that isn't already on that
  trip's plan.
- **Tool results are data, not instructions.** Descriptions come from
  OpenStreetMap and Tavily. The system prompt says so, because
  "ignore previous instructions" in a venue blurb is a real thing.

Fixture mode works: with `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROAM_FIXTURES=1`, `askAboutItinerary()`
returns a canned reply over the recorded plan, so the sheet can be built and
reviewed before anyone has an API key.

Model notes, since they bite: the model id is `claude-sonnet-5`, thinking is
adaptive by default, and **`budget_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p` and `top_k`
all return 400**. `output_config.effort` is the only dial — it is set to
`medium`, which is the latency dial for this surface.

---

## Media: how to render it, and the one hard rule

`experience_media` stores **pointers and attribution only**. No video is ever
copied or rehosted — the schema has no column for it.

```ts
switch (card.media_kind) {
  case 'tiktok':
    // Public, keyless: https://www.tiktok.com/oembed?url=<encoded source_url>
  case 'instagram':
    // Keyless since June 2026 (App Review no longer required):
    // https://graph.facebook.com/v20.0/instagram_oembed?url=<encoded source_url>
  case 'hosted_video':
  case 'image':
    // Ours or licensed — render directly.
  case 'placeholder':
  default:
    // Branded placeholder; use `short_description` as alt text.
}
```

**Always render `media_attribution_name` and link `media_attribution_url`** when
`media_license === 'oembed'`. That's the condition on which embedding is
permitted.

Everything is currently seeded as `placeholder`, so the app looks finished with
zero API keys. Swapping in a real post is a data change, not a code change.

---

## Errors

| Message | Cause |
|---|---|
| `not signed in` | No anonymous session — call `signInAnonymously()` |
| `no trip yet` | Scheduling before Stage 2 — prompt trip creation |
| `unknown city <slug>` | Bad slug; use one from `trip_options()` |
| `trip not found` / `itinerary entry not found` | Deleted in another tab |

Reads return empty arrays rather than raising, so empty states are the normal
path, not an error path.

---

## Setup

```bash
for f in supabase/migrations/*.sql supabase/seed.sql; do
  psql "$SUPABASE_DB_URL" -f "$f"
done
```

Then enable **Authentication → Providers → Anonymous** in the Supabase
dashboard. That's the whole setup.
